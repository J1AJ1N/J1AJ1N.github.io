    <p>Project goals<br>
Hotel information is often scattered across different platforms, requiring users to spend a significant amount of time comparing options. To improve user experience, this project aims to use information visualization methods to present hotelsâ€™ spatial distribution, price ranges, and star ratings. When users click on a hotel, room photos will be displayed. An interactive display page will be built to help users make decisions more quickly.<br>project process<br>
<br>1.	Collect information about hotels in Singapore, such as location, price, and rating.
<br>2.	Mark the hotels on a map and use colors to distinguish price ranges (lighter colors represent lower prices, while darker colors represent higher prices).
<br>3.	Add a filter that allows users to select their preferred price range.
<br>4.	When a user clicks on a hotel on the map, display the room photos.
